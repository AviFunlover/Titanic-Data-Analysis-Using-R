# We'll start our visual analysis of the data focusing on questions related to survival rates. Specifically, these questions will use the factor (i.e., categorical) variables in the data. Factor data is very common in the business context and ggplot2 offers many powerful features for visualizing factor data.

# Q1- What was the survival rate? 
# As Survived is a factor (i.e., categorical) variable, a bar chart 
# is a great visualization to use.
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = survived)) + geom_bar()

# If you want percentages.
prop.table(table(titanic$survived))

# Add some customization for labels and themes.
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = survived)) + theme_bw() + geom_bar() +labs(y = "Passenger Count", title = "Titanic Survival Rates")

# Q2- What was the survival rate by gender? 
# We can use color to look at two aspects (i.e., dimensions)
# of the data simultaneously.
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = sex, fill = survived)) + theme_bw() + geom_bar() +  labs(y = "Passenger Count", title = "Titanic Survival Rates by Sex")

# Q3- What was the survival rate by the class of ticket? 
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = pclass, fill = survived)) + theme_bw() + geom_bar() +labs(y = "Passenger Count", title = "Titanic Survival Rates by pclass")

# Q4- What was the survival rate by class of ticket and gender?
# We can leverage facets to further segment the data and enable "visual drill-down" into the data.
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = sex, fill = survived)) +theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~ pclass) + geom_bar() + labs(y = "Passenger Count", title = "Titanic Survival Rates by Pclass and Sex")

# Next, we'll move on to visualizing continuous (i.e., numeric)
# data using ggplot2. We'll explore visualizations of single numeric variables (i.e., columns) and also illustrate how
# ggplot2 enables visual drill-down on numeric data.

# Q5 - What is the distribution of passenger ages?
# The histogram is a staple of visualizing numeric data as it very powerfully communicates the distribution of a variable (i.e., column).
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = age)) + theme_bw() + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + labs(y = "Passenger Count", x = "Age (binwidth = 5)", title = "Titanic Age Distribution")

# Q6- What are the survival rates by age?
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = age, fill = survived)) + theme_bw() +  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + labs(y = "Passenger Count", x = "Age (binwidth = 5)",title = "Titanic Survival Rates by Age")

# Another great visualization for this question is the box-and-whisker plot.
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = survived, y = age)) +  theme_bw() + geom_boxplot() +  labs(y = "Age", x = "Survived", title = "Titanic Survival Rates by Age")




# Q7- What is the survival rates by age when segmented by gender and class of ticket?
# A related visualization to the histogram is a density plot. Think of a density plot as a smoothed version of the histogram. Using ggplot2 we can use facets to allow for visual drill-down via density plots.
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = age, fill = survived)) + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(sex ~ pclass) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + labs(y = "Age", x = "Survived", title = "Titanic Survival Rates by Age, Pclass and Sex")

# If you prefer histograms, no problem!
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = age, fill = survived)) + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(sex ~ pclass) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + labs(y = "Age", x = "Survived", title = "Titanic Survival Rates by Age, Pclass and Sex")
